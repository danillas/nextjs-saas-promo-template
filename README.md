# 🚀 NextJS Saas promo template
---

This is a modified [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Purpose of this repo
I've decided to make template, to help speed up the launch and testing of hypotheses. You're free to offer new features, just make an issue or PR.

## Everything you need to get started
✅ [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS\
✅ [FSD](https://fsd.how/) folders structure\
✅ [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide) icon pack\
✅ [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (instead of Eslint, Prettier)\
✅ Minimum pages for example (Home, Blog)\

> 👁️ No Dark theme. Save time on debug

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
